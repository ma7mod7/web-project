          <p> player of the year for the first time - or will Mohamed Salah (right) pick up the award for the third
            time? The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his
            authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed
            diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving, as fighting there
            continues.

            Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been
            able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat everyday.

            Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries "almost impossible", Mr Skau said.

            Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.

            Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht told the BBC on Saturday that "any death and pain to a
            civilian is painful, but we don't have an alternative". </p>

          <p>Many people of conscience are looking for ways to support Palestinians in Gaza as violence continues to
            escalate. On Oct. 7, a Hamas-led attack on Israel killed at least 1,200 Israelis and took an estimated 200
            hostages. Israel immediately launched attacks on Gaza. As of Dec. 4, Israeli attacks have killed 16,200
            Palestinians (over 40% of them children) in Gaza. Thousands more are still buried under the rubble. Over
            three-quarters of Gaza's population—1.9 million people—have been displaced from their homes. </p>

          <p>UN secretary general António Guterres has spoken about the "serious risk to the maintenance of
            international
            peace and security" in the Gaza conflict, citing the spillover of hostilities in "the occupied West Bank,
            Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen".

            He triggered Article 99, prompting a UN Security Council vote on Friday, because he believes this is a very
            urgent matter which must be brought to the attention of the council.

            The Israeli government detests the UN and they detest the secretary general.

            The Israelis rejected his description, claiming Mr Guterres is in fact the threat to world peace because he
            is
            pandering to Hamas by trying to end the fighting now, before their mission to destroy the group has been
            concluded. </p>

          <p>Once hailed by many people as a saviour, Egypt's strongman leader Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is now seen in a
            very
            different light.

            Egyptians who took to the streets to cheer for the general-turned-president a decade ago are not as happy as
            they hoped they would be.

            As Mr Sisi runs for his third consecutive term as president next week, a crumbling economy is top of most
            people's list of complaints.

            Nadia is one of those struggling to make ends meet as Mr Sisi's government continues to implement what it
            calls "economic reforms".

            The 57-year-old widow and mother of six can barely make a living selling newspapers at a street-side kiosk.
